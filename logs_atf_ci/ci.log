./components/vis/messages.tsx
113:9  Warning: The 'fetchMessages' function makes the dependencies of useCallback Hook (at line 224) change on every render. To fix this, wrap the definition of 'fetchMessages' in its own useCallback() Hook.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
144:6  Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'stream'. Either include it or remove the dependency array.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps

./components/vis/stream/stream-table.tsx
205:6  Warning: React Hook useMemo has an unnecessary dependency: 'x2ui._db.cur_cluster.streams'. Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like 'x2ui._db.cur_cluster.streams' aren't valid dependencies because mutating them doesn't re-render the component.  react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
